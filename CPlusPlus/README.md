This is the Grand Exchange look up from OSRS Wiki program written in C++.

If you want to just run the program, go run application "RunescapeGE.exe" in folder/directory "CPlusPlus/Release"

This program searches GE info every 5 seconds. I have chosen 5 items to search up. You can change these values under "item1", "item2", etc. under "RunescapeGE.soln".
