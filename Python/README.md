This is the Grand Exchange look up from OSRS Wiki program written in Python.

If you want to just run the program, go run application "RunescapeGEMain.py" and run it.

This program searches GE info every 5 seconds. I have chosen 5 items to search up. You can change these values under "item1", "item2", etc. under "RunescapeGEMain.py".
